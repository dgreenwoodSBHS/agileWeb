    <h2 class="content"> Pros Of Solar Power </h2>
    <p>
        -It is renewable energy earning it will never run out if the sun is alive and with the amount of the earth the sun covers we would be able to gather more energy than we can use  <br>
        
        -Solar energy is sustainable meaning for future generations it won't become a hassle to deal with for future generations unlike coal where it creates fossil fuels that will eventually harm the environment and will someday run out unlike solar which it will never do bad and will never run out. <br>
        
        -Save on electricity with solar panels or solar roofs you can buy for your own home you can save money and with some company's even sell extra electricity back to them. <br>

     <h2 class="content"> Cons Of Solar Power </h2>
    <p>
        -It's not always sunny, meaning at night and in early mornings you can always have your solar panels taking in the sunlight to power your home and even of bad weather days you can still obtain some power but not as much on a sunny day. <br>
