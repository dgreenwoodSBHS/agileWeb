    <h2 class="content"> Pros Of Solar Power </h2>
    <p>
        -It is renewable energy earning it will never run out if the sun is alive and with the amount of the earth the sun covers we would be able to gather more energy than we can use  <br>
        
        -Solar energy is sustainable meaning for future generations it won't become a hassle to deal with for future generations unlike coal where it creates fossil fuels that will eventually harm the environment and will someday run out unlike solar which it will never do bad and will never run out. <br>
        
        -Save on electricity with solar panels or solar roofs you can buy for your own home you can save money and with some company's even sell extra electricity back to them. <br>
        
        -Can be used to power things with no connection to an electrical grid for example in a place in Africa can be used to power a water distiller that has no connection to a grid. <br>
        
        -Silent to run, no large coal factory's making loud noises etc. <br>
        
        -Low maintenance with only needing to be washed a few times a year and if they get damaged the manufactures even give out 20-25-year warranties on their panels. <br>

     <h2 class="content"> Cons Of Solar Power </h2>
    <p>
        -It's not always sunny, meaning at night and in early mornings you can always have your solar panels taking in the sunlight to power your home and even of bad weather days you can still obtain some power but not as much on a sunny day. <br>
        
        -It requires space so if you happen to have a small roof you won't be able to fit too many panels on it which won't provide enough electricity as a bigger roof persay <br>
