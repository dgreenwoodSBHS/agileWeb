	<h2>Stats</h2>
	<p>In 2014, the top carbon dioxide (CO2) emitters were China (30%), the United States 
	(15%), the European Union (9%), India (7%), the Russian Federation (5%), and Japan (4%).
	These data include CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, as well as cement manufacturing
	and gas flaring. Together, these sources represent a large proportion of total global CO2 emissions.
	Emissions and sinks related to changes in land use are not included in these estimates. However, changes 
	in land use can be important: estimates indicate that net global greenhouse gas emissions from 
	agriculture, forestry, and other land use were over 8 billion metric tons of CO2 equivalent,[2] or about 
	24% of total global greenhouse gas emissions.[3] In areas such as the United States and Europe, changes 
	in land use associated with human activities have the net effect of absorbing CO2, partially offsetting 
	the emissions from deforestation in other regions
